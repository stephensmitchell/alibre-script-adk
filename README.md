To run Alibre Script code from an Alibre Design addon, only the ScriptRunner class is required. This repository (the alibre-script-adk) and its related content were created to provide community and public resources, but they are not required. There are example addons under my account that demonstrate the ScriptRunner integration and addon development.

If you need assistance integrating Alibre Script into your project, or have any questions regarding Alibre Script and Alibre addon development, create an issue or join my Discord server. Thank you.
